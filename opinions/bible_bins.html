		<h2>What's a Bible Bin?</h2>

		<p>God speaks to us through his holy, divinely inspired word: the Bible. It can be hard to keep track of all the stories, verses, and teachings that are relevant to all the various topics in the Word, hence this reference. A bin is a category which is supported by verses/stories from the Bible. This is an ever expanding list.</p>

		<h4>Awesomeness of God</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>God's Name</b> - The name of God is beyond our limited human understanding.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>He replied, "Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding." - <b>Judges 13:18</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Creation is a Witness to the Awesomeness of God</b> - Our universe is full of irreducibly complex structure and design. This is not a scientifically provable idea, but it has been made clear to all human beings across time. Man cannot claim that there was no evidence of God's existence.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse. - <b>Romans 1:18-20</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God Explains His Majesty and Power</b> - When correcting Job, God provides a detailed description of creation and His awesome power. It is both beautiful and terrifying.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>See <b>Job 38</b>, <b>Job 39</b>, <b>Job 40:15-24</b>, and <b>Job 41</b>.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God's Power</b> - God is all powerful. He controls everything in creation, regardless of the "limitations" put in place by human beings.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>“To God belong wisdom and power;</br>
    counsel and understanding are his.</br>
What he tears down cannot be rebuilt;</br>
    those he imprisons cannot be released.</br>
If he holds back the waters, there is drought;</br>
    if he lets them loose, they devastate the land.</br>
To him belong strength and insight;</br>
    both deceived and deceiver are his.</br>
He leads rulers away stripped</br>
    and makes fools of judges.</br>
He takes off the shackles put on by kings</br>
    and ties a loincloth around their waist.</br>
He leads priests away stripped</br>
    and overthrows officials long established.</br>
He silences the lips of trusted advisers</br>
    and takes away the discernment of elders.</br>
He pours contempt on nobles</br>
    and disarms the mighty.</br>
He reveals the deep things of darkness</br>
    and brings utter darkness into the light.</br>
He makes nations great, and destroys them;</br>
    he enlarges nations, and disperses them.</br>
He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason;</br>
    he makes them wander in a trackless waste.</br>
They grope in darkness with no light;</br>
    he makes them stagger like drunkards. - <b>Job 12:13-25</b></p>
			</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Jesus has Overcome All the Troubles of the World</b> - Life is full of hardship and suffering. But as challenging as life on Earth is, we take take heart in the fact that Jesus overcame the world!</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.” - <b>John 16:33</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Jesus is I AM</b> - One of the very significant stories to the Jews at Jesus' time was the story of Moses and the burning bush, in which God tells Moses that "I AM" sent him to the Israelites. By calling himself "I AM", Jesus is hitting at the core of the Jewish leader's religious symbols.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!” - <b>John 8:58</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Failure of Salvation by Works</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Human's Are Quick to Break God's Law</b> - God is in the middle of giving the Israelites massive victories over their enemies, and yet Achan still sins by stealing some of the items which were devoted to God.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions." - <b>Joshua 7:11</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Sin Prevents Us From Pleasing God</b> - Joshua makes the claim that the Israelites are not even capable of serving God. The works of the Israelites will not be sufficient.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Joshua said to the people, "You are not able to serve the Lord. He is a holy God; he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins. If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after he has been good to you." - <b>Joshua 24:19-20</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Faith</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Faith is a Path to Righteousness</b> - God spoke to Abram and promised him things that would not necessarily take place in his lifetime. Abram's belief in God and what God promised was credited to him as righteousness.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness. - <b>Genesis 15:6</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Faith in God is Reliable</b> - Ezra boasted about God's power to the king of Persia and as a result, was forced to depend on God for protection on his journey rather than the king's soldiers.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him." So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer. - <b>Ezra 8:22-23</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Abramham's Faith Saved Him, Not His Works</b> - Paul makes very clear in his letter to the Romans that the commonly held view by the Jews that Abraham was simply righteous enough to save himself is wrong. Abraham's faith in God saved him.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” - <b>Romans 4:3</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>A Child's Complete, Trusting Faith Saves</b> - There were many proud adults who came to Jesus throughout his ministry asking Him how they could be saved. Jesus pointed to the little children around him for the answer. Just as a child completely and totally trusts in their parents for their needs to be met, so to must we trust in God for our needs and our salvation.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” - <b>Matthew 19:14</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” - <b>Mark 10:13-15</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.” - <b>Luke 18:16-18</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Then he said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.” - <b>Luke 9:48</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>The Holy Spirit, Through Faith, Allows Us to Speak Boldly</b> - Peter and John were both uneducated men. Yet the Spirit gave them a profound understanding of the Scriptures and a boldness in sharing the message of the gospel. As a consequence, the Sanhedrin was astonished at how articulate they were about their faith in Jesus. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of the people! If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed, then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. Jesus is</br>
</br>
“‘the stone you builders rejected,</br>
    which has become the cornerstone.’</br>
</br>
Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”</br>
</br>
When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus. - <b>Acts 4:8-13</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Faith is Potent and Powerful</b> - Faith is very powerful. It does not take much to do great things. Jesus describes that having faith the size of a mustard seed is enough to (metaphorically) uproot trees and move mountains.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>He replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you." - <b>Luke 17:6</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.” - <b>Matthew 21:21-22</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Have faith in God,” Jesus answered. “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." - <b>Mark 11:22-24</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>He replied, “Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.” - <b>Matthew 17:20</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Faith Brings Great Heavenly Rewards</b> - It can be difficult to sacrifice the temporary things of this life for faith in Jesus Christ. But we have His promise that we will be rewarded in heaven.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first. - <b>Matthew 19:29-30</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Faith Leads to A Better Understanding of Scripture</b> - Our relationship with Jesus Christ through faith, helps us to better understand scripture.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>He said, “The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,</br>
</br>
“‘though seeing, they may not see;</br>
    though hearing, they may not understand.’" - <b>Luke 8:10</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>He told them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables so that,</br>
</br>
“‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving,</br>
    and ever hearing but never understanding;</br>
otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’” - <b>Mark 4:11-12</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them." - <b>Matthew 13:11-12</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Faith Allows Us to Offload Our Burdens onto Christ</b> - Jesus welcomes us with open arms. He wants to take away our sin-related burdens and give us peace and rest. The more faith that we have, the more that we can lean into that blessing!</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” - <b>Matthew 11:28-30</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Faith can Bring Earthly Rewards</b> - Faith can introduce opportunities here on earth. God loves to reward those with faith. Be careful not to take this as a promotion of the prosperity gospel however, God does not "owe" you anything.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. - <b>Matthew 7:7-8</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete. - <b>John 16:24</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God's Relationship with Man is Not an Obligation</b> - God does not owe us anything. If we sin, it has no impact on Him. Our righteousness is of no benefit to Him. As a consequence, we need to humble ourselves and establish our relationship with God through faith. We should not expect Him to be at our beckon call out of some obligation to make up for all the suffering that we have "undeservedly" experienced in this life.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Look up at the heavens and see;</br>
    gaze at the clouds so high above you.</br>
If you sin, how does that affect him?</br>
    If your sins are many, what does that do to him?</br>
If you are righteous, what do you give to him,</br>
    or what does he receive from your hand?</br>
Your wickedness only affects humans like yourself,</br>
    and your righteousness only other people. - <b>Job 35:5-8</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Faith of the Early Church</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b> Faith was so Strong they Rejoiced in Suffering </b> - Incredible that the Apostles were so strong in their faith that they rejoiced about being counted worthy of suffering.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p> The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. - <b>Acts 5:41</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Their Faith even Trumped their Personal Wealth Concerns</b> - It's incredible that their faith was so strong in the early church that they pooled their wealth to help each other and the needy. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p> All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had. With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And God's grace was so powerfully at work in them all that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need.

					Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means “son of encouragement”), sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet. - <b>Acts 4:32-37</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>God is Sovereign</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>God is All Powerful and Sovereign Over the Whole Universe</b> - Job correctly recognizes the power of God. He knows his place; he does not condemn God (in this section). Because God is sovereign, Job says that he could not possibly contend with God successfully. As unappealing as this reality is to those outside the faith, it is none the less true.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"How then can I dispute with him?<br></br>
					How can I find words to argue with him?<br></br>
					Though I were innocent, I could not answer him;<br></br>
					I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.<br></br>
					Even if I summoned him and he responded,<br></br>
					I do not believe he would give me a hearing.<br></br>
					He would crush me with a storm<br></br>
					and multiply my wounds for no reason.<br></br>
					He would not let me catch my breath<br></br>
					but would overwhelm me with misery.<br></br>
					If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty!<br></br>
					And if it is a matter of justice, who can challenge him?<br></br>
					Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me;<br></br>
					if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.<br></br>
					- <b>Job 9:14-20</b></p>
			</blockquote>

		<h4>God's Use of Lowly People</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>God Uses the Humble</b> - God chose Gideon to save Israel from the Midianites and become their judge, even though he described himself as the weakest family member from the weakest tribe in Manasseh.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"Pardon me, my lord," Gideon replied, "but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family." - <b>Judges 6:15</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God Uses Those That World Sees as Weak</b> - The Benjaminites were punished by the rest of Israel after their behaviour in Judges 19. Saul was a descendent of some the surviving Benjaminites, and as a consequence, would not have been the first choice by any human standard to be the first king of Israel. Yet God still decided to make him the first king.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Saul answered, "But am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?" - <b>1 Samuel 9:21</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God Can Elevate the Humble</b> - Saul started off believing that he was insignificant, even in his own eyes. But God made him the king over all of Israel.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Samuel said, "Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord annointed you king over Israel." - <b>1 Samuel 15:17</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>The Golden Rule</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Golden Rule References</b> - The "Golden Rule" is what christians call the rule given by Jesus/God that sums up the law and the prophets. Really the entire law boils down to the idea of "love others as yourself (including your enemies) and love God". Nothing else matters quite as much as this. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” - <b>John 13:34-35</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for; through the fear of the Lord evil is avoided. - <b>Proverbs 16:6</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p> “You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p> - <b>Matthew 5:43-48</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p> “But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you.

					“If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</p> - <b>Luke 6:27-36</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p> So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. </p> - <b>Matthew 7:12</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p> “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”

					Jesus replied: “'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” </p> - <b>Matthew 22:36-40</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p> “The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.”</p> - <b>Mark 12:29-31</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  He answered, “'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'”</p> - <b>Luke 10:27</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Greed</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Greed is Unquenchable</b> - From the worldly perspective, Haman had it all. He was second in command over a vast empire, he had a large family and lots of wealth, he had people bow down to him wherever he went. But all this was not enough. His greed destroyed him.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials. "And that's not all," Haman added. "I'm the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she had invited me along with the king tomorrow. But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king's gate." - <b>Esther 5:11-13</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Heaven</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Angels Present Themselves Before God</b> - God is ruler over all, that includes angelic beings and Satan himself.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them. - <b>Job 1:6</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>How God Works</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>God Does Not Change His Mind</b> - God can see the whole picture: past, present and future. Thus he does not ever need to change his mind.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind." - <b>1 Samuel 15:29</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God Makes Himself Known to Those Who Seek Him</b> - If you make a sincere effort to pursue God, He will reveal himself to you. But at the same time, if you reject Him, He will leave you to your sin.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge that God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the Lord searches every heart and understands every desire and every thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will reject you forever." - <b>1 Chronicles 28:9</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>You Can be a Part of God's Plan, But He Will Find a Way With or Without You</b> - Esther was terrified of going to the king to save the Jews from Haman, and for good reason. If the king did not "forgive" her for entering his presence without a summons, she would be killed. But it was God's plan for Esther to save the Jews, and that meant facing her fear and going to the king.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?" - <b>Esther 4:14</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Human Failings</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Sin is Innate in Human Beings</b> - The first man born on earth murdered the second man born on earth.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. - <b>Genesis 4:8</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Left to Ourselves, Humans Devolve into Pure Evil</b> - The entire population of the city of Sodom went to homosexually rape the angels that had come to the city.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom - both young and old - surrounded the house. They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them." - <b>Genesis 19:4-5</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Humans Are Profoundly Wicked</b> - Gibeah's men intended to maliciously abuse and exercise their power over the Levite traveler who was passing through their town by raping him. They would not accept his concubine and a virgin as a substitute, but raped them continuously throughout the night until she died.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>While they were enjoying themselves, some of the men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, "Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him."<br><br>
					The owner of the house went outside and said to them, "No my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this outrageous thing. Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But as for this man, don't do such an outrageous thing."</br></br>
					But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. - <b>Judges 19:22-25</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Even Under Perfect Conditions, Humans Are Still Profoundly Evil</b> - David had it all, he was king over all Israel, the Lord had given him rest on all sides from his enemies, and he had the blessing of God's covenant on him. And yet, even with all that going right for him, he still commited what humans consider to be the worst possible sin: he murdered Uriah the Hittite because he was lustful for Bathsheba.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man! This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: 'I annointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. I gave your master's house to you, and your master's wives into your arms. I gave you all Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more. Why did you despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.'" - <b>2 Samuel 12:7-10</b></p>

			<li><b>The Pharisees Could Not Accept that Jesus was the Messiah</b> - In a common governmental committee fashion, the Pharisees assembled and questioned a formerly blind man multiple times. They were looking for any excuse they could find to disavow the evidence that Jesus was anything more than a demon possessed man. They simply could not accept that He was the Messiah.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a Sabbath. Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. “He put mud on my eyes,” the man replied, “and I washed, and now I see.”</br>
</br>
Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.”</br>
</br>
But others asked, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So they were divided.</br>
</br>
Then they turned again to the blind man, “What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.”</br>
</br>
The man replied, “He is a prophet.”</br>
</br>
They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man’s parents. “Is this your son?” they asked. “Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?”</br>
</br>
“We know he is our son,” the parents answered, “and we know he was born blind. But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.” His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. That was why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”</br>
</br>
A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. “Give glory to God by telling the truth,” they said. “We know this man is a sinner.”</br>
</br>
He replied, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!”</br>
</br>
Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</br>
</br>
He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?”</br>
</br>
Then they hurled insults at him and said, “You are this fellow’s disciple! We are disciples of Moses! We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don’t even know where he comes from.”</br>
</br>
The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will. Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”</br>
</br>
To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!” And they threw him out. - <b>John 9:13-34</b></p>

			<li><b>Even Humanity's Best is a Failure</b> - Peter was described as Jesus' closest friend. That is a badge of high honour. Peter spent three years traveling around with Jesus learning from Him. If ever there was a human being (in the New Testament) who was a candidate for "righteous", it would've been Peter. However, in a matter of hours, he went from promising to stay and suffer with Jesus to denying that he even knew Him three times. This is why we need a saviour.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>Then Jesus told them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written:</br>
</br>
“‘I will strike the shepherd,</br>
    and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</br>
</br>
But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</br>
</br>
Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.”</br>
</br>
“Truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”</br>
</br>
But Peter declared, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the other disciples said the same. - <b>Matthew 26:31-35</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said.</br>
</br>
But he denied it before them all. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.</br>
</br>
Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”</br>
</br>
He denied it again, with an oath: “I don’t know the man!”</br>
</br>
After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, “Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.”</br>
</br>
Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know the man!”</br>
</br>
Immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly. - <b>Matthew 26:69-75</b></p>

		<h4>Money</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Pursuing Money is Meaningless</b> - You can never have enough money to be satisfied. It is easy to spend your whole life chasing wealth, but it will be a totally unfulfilling life.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>Whoever loves money never has enough;</br>
	whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income.</br>
    This too is meaningless. - <b>Ecclesiastes 5:10</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Choose God or Money</b> - You cannot be all in on both your faith in God and the pursuit of money. There is no way to balance the two.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money." - <b>Matthew 6:24</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.” - <b>Luke 16:13</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Don't Hold onto Earthly Wealth</b> - It is important not to get too attached to our earthly wealth, but instead be willing to give it generously to others. This both strengthens our faith in God and helps others (both with their physical needs and their spiritual needs as generousity makes a powerful witness for God).</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p> Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</br>
</br>
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.</br>
</br>
Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</br>
</br>
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”</br>
</br>
Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” - <b>Matthew 19:21-26</b></p>
			</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</br>
</br>
When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.” - <b>Luke 18:22-25</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Be Wise with Your Money</b> - Make sure that you do not take on more financial obligations than you can manage. That is a recipe for disaster.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>“Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’</br>
					</br>
“Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won’t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace. In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples. - <b>Luke 14:28-33</b></p>

		<h4>Pride</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Stay Humble, For God Rules Over You</b> - Despite being second only to Pharaoh, Joseph didn't let his pride go to his head. He had the opportunity to enslave his brothers and punish them for what they did to him, but he rhetorically responds: "Am I in the place of God?".</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>But Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God?" - <b>Genesis 50:19</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Give Praise to God Instead of Your Own Ego</b> - Daniel gives us a great example of how to remain humble and keep our pride under control. Remember that it is only by God's grace and mercy that we are able to do anything. When we are tempted to take credit and inflate our egos, we should instead give that praise to God.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>Daniel replied, “No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you were lying in bed are these:</br>
					</br>
“As Your Majesty was lying there, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind. - <b>Daniel 2:27-30</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Keep Your Pride in Check</b> - King Nebuchadnezzar was prone to stroke his own ego, and assume that he was more powerful and awesome than he really was. God punished him for his pride by making him insane.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>he said, “Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?” - <b>Daniel 4:30</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>We are No Better than Our Ancestors</b> - Many people assume that we are better than our ancestors were. We are smarter, more sophisticated, wiser, less gullible, etc. Jesus himself warns against that attitude. We are in no way superior to our ancestors. Had we been in their place, we would've done what they did!</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’ So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started! - <b>Matthew 23:30-32</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Our Pride Condemns Us</b> - Because we claim that we know what we are doing, which is an expression of pride, we are guilty of sin! If only we would repent and cast off our pride, God would forgive us.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains." - <b>John 9:41</b></p>

		<h4>Prophesy of Christ</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Jacob's Prediction</b> - In Jacob's blessing of Judah, he mentions that "the scepter will not depart from Judah ... until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his."</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet,</br>until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his. - <b>Genesis 49:18</b></p>

		</ul>

		<h4>Questions for a Theologian</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>What was David's Sin?</b> - David enrolls the fighting men in Israel after God prompts him to. But as a consequence, God sends a disease on the land that kills seventy thousand Israelites. In verse 10, David is "conscience-stricken". What was his sin?</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the Lord, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, Lord, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing." - <b>2 Samuel 24:10</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>What did Job's friends do wrong?</b> - All throughout the book of Job, Job's friends were solidly convinced that Job must've sinned. They could see no other reason for is suffering. (Because of course, none of the men were aware of the discussion that happened between satan and God in heaven.) They seemed to have faith in the fact that God could not be unjust or wrong in his condemnation of Job. However, at the very end of Job, despite the fact that God strongly corrects Job, He also requires that Job sacrifice and pray for his friends. What exactly was their "folly"?</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has.” - <b>Job 42:8</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Why is Solomon seemingly approving sex with prostitutes?</b> - One of the strongest messages that we hear from Solomon in all of his writings on wisdom is to avoid adultery. However, in this passage, he seems to imply that sex with a prostitute is cheap and carries very little consequence?</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>Do not lust in your heart after her beauty</br>
    or let her captivate you with her eyes.</br>
</br>
For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread,</br>
    but another man’s wife preys on your very life. - <b>Proverbs 6:25-26</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>What "generation" will not pass away before the end times come to pass?</b> - Immediately following Jesus' description of the destruction of the temple and the signs of the end times, he promises that "this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened." Who is he refering to? Clearly it can't be the literal men listening to him, since they are dead and the end times have not yet come. Is He instead refering to Christians in the church age? If so, that seems like somewhat of a circular definition. The church age continues until the end times and the end times don't start until the end of the church age.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. - <b>Matthew 24:34</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>What are the implications of this story?</b> - The story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16 is a very deep and impactful story. There are so many questions that it brings up, like: can people in heaven and hell physically see each other? are these the consequences of living in luxury on earth? It would be great to get a theologian's perspective on this story.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>“There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</br>
</br>
“The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried. In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’</br>
</br>
“But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’</br>
</br>
“He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’</br>
</br>
“Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’</br>
</br>
“‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’</br>
</br>
“He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’” - <b>Luke 16:19-31</b></p>
				</pre>

		<h4>Revenge</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Vengence is God's, Not Ours</b> - David would not kill Saul, even when the circumstances he found himself in gave him the perfect opportunity to do so. David was content with God's promise that he would be king. He felt no need to rush the process by taking action himself.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"As surely as the Lord lives," he said, "the Lord himself will strike him, or his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish. But the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lord's annointed." - <b>1 Samuel 26:10-11</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Salvation</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>The Symmetry of the Need for a Triumphant Saviour</b> - This is beautiful example of symmetry where God's solution to one man resulting in the damnation of all is to bring one man into the earth who can save all. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. - <b>Romans 5:18-19</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Appearance of Righteousness is Meaningless. Your Actual Heart is What Matters. </b> - Circumcision is just a symbol. It does not save you. Those who follow the law but are not physically circumcised are still circumcised at heart. Physical symbols and the outward appearance of following the law are not important to God. It is what is actually in your heart that matters. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>  Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised. So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised? The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.

					A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person's praise is not from other people, but from God. - <b>Romans 2:25-29</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Denying Christ is the Only Unforgivable Act</b> - These verses describe that blaspheming against the Holy Spirit is the only unforgivable sin. We believe this is refering to the act of refusing the salvation offered through Jesus Christ. The only action that can prevent you from everlasting life. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. - <b>Luke 12:10</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. - <b>Matthew 12:31-32</b></p>

			<li><b>Salvation Summarized Nicely. All are Welcome.</b> - Beautiful summary of the ideas of salvation. Makes a point to say that Jesus died for all mankind, not just the Jews. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.” - <b>Acts 4:12</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>You are Either a Slave to Sin or a Slave to God. One is Far More Desirable</b> - All people are either a slave to sin or a slave to God. When you live for yourself with the intention of satisfying all your desires and self-centered personal goals you are a slave to Sin. This leads to the inevitable emptiness that the meaninglessness of life brings. Following God and living like Jesus brings Joy (far more lasting than simple happiness) and meaning. This is now possible with Jesus' sacrifice, as we are not burdened with perfectly following the law but can still have this meaning-giving relationship with God. 
				That does not leave us as a free, neutral party: thanking Jesus and going about our business independently of Him. No we then have the ability to choose to serve Him as willful indentured servants or sons of God. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses. - <b>Acts 13:39</b></p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>  Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. I know that you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word. I am telling you what I have seen in the Fathers presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.” - <b>John 8:34-38</b></p>

				<p>  Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. - <b>John 8:42-44</b></p>

			<li><b>What Good is Gaining the Whole World if in the Process You Lose Your Soul?</b> - Following God does imply giving up some of the things the world has to offer, but these things are empty when compared to keeping your soul when in a relationship with God.

			<li><b>Satan Never Admits Defeat</b> - Satan incited God to strike Job by taking away all of his belongings. Satan claimed that Job would curse God, but Job did not. Instead of admitting that he was wrong, he simply moved the goalposts by claiming instead that Job would curse God if God took away Job's physical health.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason." - <b>Job 2:3</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Satan's Routine</b> - Satan roams around the earth, looking to stir up trouble. Don't think that he's far off, or not paying attention.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The Lord said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"<br></br>
					Satan answered the Lord, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it." - <b>Job 1:7</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Satan is a Murderer and the Father of Lies</b> - Satan is an irredeemable being. He lies so completely that Jesus describes lying as his native language.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. - <b>John 8:44</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Sin</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Paul's Answer to the Nicolaitans' Sect</b> - It is not acceptable to just sin even if God has forgiven all sin already. We can make so much more of our lives. </li>
			<blockquote>
				What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? - <b>Romans 6:1-2</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Man is Basically Evil</b> - Man is not basically good. Man is basically evil. All have sinned. There is no one righteous, not even one. No one can be perfectly good on their own.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p> As it is written:</br></br>
					 “There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.” “Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The poison of vipers is on their lips.” “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.” “Their feet are swift to shed blood; ruin and misery mark their ways, and the way of peace they do not know.” “There is no fear of God before their eyes.” for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, - <b>Romans 3:10-18,23</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Sinfulness Cannot be Justified by the Excuse it Makes God Look Good</b> - Sinfulness cannot be justified by saying it makes God look good or by saying that since Jesus died for our sins we have the right to sin as much as we like. Sin is not necessary for good to exist and there is no truth to the idea of balance between good and evil in the world. Sin is a disease that must be fought and destroyed. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p> But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.) Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world? Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?” Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is just! - <b>Romans 3:5-8</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Sinning Against God is Often About the Intention of the Heart</b> - Here Paul cast out a demon with God's power however he did it simply becuase he was annoyed, not becuase it was necessarily the right thing to do. Later it seems he would go through trails becuase of this descision. Sinning is often more about the intention of a person's heart rather than just the disobediance of a written rule. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p> She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her. - <b>Acts 16:18</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>The Fall of Man has Resulted in us Receiving the Great Burden of Life</b> - Since humanity is fallen we are doomed to toil away without meaning unless we find God. Solomon was the wisest man to have ever lived and he came to this conclusion from watching the world. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind. - <b>Ecclesiastes 1:13-14</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Lust in Itself is Sinful and Destructive</b> - If you even just lustfully look at another person you run the risk of causing destruction in your life as temptation often follows these sort of envious situations. It also is unhealthy to reduce love to lust and poisons your mind. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. - <b>Matthew 5:28</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Suffering</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Suffering Leads to Perseverance, Character, and Hope</b> - Suffering leads a person to God, which leads to Godly strength being given. This allows a person to persevere and to gain a hope stronger than anything a human could produce on their own. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p> Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. - <b>Romans 5:3-4</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God Can Use Your Suffering for Good</b> - Joseph went through alot of suffering in his life. But he was convinced that his suffering had a purpose: to save many lives.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. - <b>Genesis 45:5</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God Can Use Your Suffering to Display His Glory to Others</b> - Jesus ran across a man who was blind from birth. Jesus was able to use his suffering to show His glory to an entire community of people.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”</br>
</br>
“Neither this man nor his parents sinned,” said Jesus, “but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him." - <b>John 9:1-3</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Suffering Increases Faith</b> - If your life is too good, you may get the idea that you have no need for God. Some suffering exists so that your faith and relationship with God may be strengthened.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.</br>
</br>
“The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’</br>
</br>
“‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.</br>
</br>
“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’</br>
</br>
“‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’” - <b>Matthew 13:24-30</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Symbols</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Don't Confuse Religious Symbolism for a Relationship with God</b> - The Israelites confused a genuine relationship with God through faith, sacrifice, and obedience with the symbol that the ark of the covenant. As a consequence, the ark was lost to the Philistines and many Israelites were slain.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the Lord bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lord's covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies." - <b>1 Samuel 4:3</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Temptation</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>How to Avoid Temptation Before it Even Starts</b> - Once in temptation it can be very hard as humans to fight it. To help avoid this ask God to keep temptation out of your life. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p> “Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.” - <b>Matthew 26:41</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Remove Sources of Temptation From Your Life</b> - As mentioned in the above point it can be very hard to fight temptation once it's bearing down on you. One way to counter this in addition to prayer is to cut out the things in life that may contribute to your temptation. </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. - <b>Matthew 5:29-30</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. - <b>Matthew 18:8-9</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out. And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, - <b>Mark 9:43-47</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>  Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. - <b>Romans 6:13</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>The Evils of Causing Someone Else to Stumble</b> - According to God, causing someone else to sin is one of the worst things you can do. Avoid this! </li>
			<blockquote>
				<p> It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble. - <b>Luke 17:2</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>The Law</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Obedience is Better than Sacrifice</b> - In Saul's arrogance, he did not obey what God told him to do when he attacked the Amalekites. Instead of killing all of the livestock, he took them back to sacrifice to the Lord. Samuel told Saul that obedience is better than sacrifice to God.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>But Samuel replied:</br></br>
					"Does the Lord delight in burnt offering and sacrifices as much as in obeying the Lord? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams." - <b>1 Samuel 15:22</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Wisdom</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>God is the Source of All Wisdom</b> - In this beautiful piece about wisdom, the author of Job elegantly explains that the only source of wisdom is God. It cannot be found, or bought, or traded for.</li>
			<blockquote>
			<pre>
				<p>There is a mine for silver</br>
    and a place where gold is refined.</br>
Iron is taken from the earth,</br>
    and copper is smelted from ore.</br>
Mortals put an end to the darkness;</br>
    they search out the farthest recesses</br>
    for ore in the blackest darkness.</br>
Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft,</br>
    in places untouched by human feet;</br>
    far from other people they dangle and sway.</br>
The earth, from which food comes,</br>
    is transformed below as by fire;</br>
lapis lazuli comes from its rocks,</br>
    and its dust contains nuggets of gold.</br>
No bird of prey knows that hidden path,</br>
    no falcon’s eye has seen it.</br>
Proud beasts do not set foot on it,</br>
    and no lion prowls there.</br>
People assault the flinty rock with their hands</br>
    and lay bare the roots of the mountains.</br>
They tunnel through the rock;</br>
    their eyes see all its treasures.</br>
They search the sources of the rivers</br>
    and bring hidden things to light.</br>
</br>
But where can wisdom be found?</br>
    Where does understanding dwell?</br>
No mortal comprehends its worth;</br>
    it cannot be found in the land of the living.</br>
The deep says, “It is not in me”;</br>
    the sea says, “It is not with me.”</br>
It cannot be bought with the finest gold,</br>
    nor can its price be weighed out in silver.</br>
It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir,</br>
    with precious onyx or lapis lazuli.</br>
Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it,</br>
    nor can it be had for jewels of gold.</br>
Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention;</br>
    the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.</br>
The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it;</br>
    it cannot be bought with pure gold.</br>
</br>
Where then does wisdom come from?</br>
    Where does understanding dwell?</br>
It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing,</br>
    concealed even from the birds in the sky.</br>
Destruction and Death say,</br>
    “Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.”</br>
God understands the way to it</br>
    and he alone knows where it dwells,</br>
for he views the ends of the earth</br>
    and sees everything under the heavens.</br>
When he established the force of the wind</br>
    and measured out the waters,</br>
when he made a decree for the rain</br>
    and a path for the thunderstorm,</br>
then he looked at wisdom and appraised it;</br>
    he confirmed it and tested it.</br>
And he said to the human race,</br>
    “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom,</br>
    and to shun evil is understanding.” - <b>Job 28</b></p>
			</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Wisdom Cannot Be Purchased</b> - There is no price that one can pay to acquire wisdom. It has an infinite value.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>But where can wisdom be found?</br>
    Where does understanding dwell?</br>
No mortal comprehends its worth;</br>
    it cannot be found in the land of the living.</br>
The deep says, “It is not in me”;</br>
    the sea says, “It is not with me.”</br>
It cannot be bought with the finest gold,</br>
    nor can its price be weighed out in silver.</br>
It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir,</br>
    with precious onyx or lapis lazuli.</br>
Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it,</br>
    nor can it be had for jewels of gold.</br>
Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention;</br>
    the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.</br>
The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it;</br>
    it cannot be bought with pure gold. - <b>Job 28:12-19</b></p>
			</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God Used His Wisdom to Create and Maintain the Universe</b> - As the author of wisdom, God is best able to apply it to our world. We can see that in His creation and it's irreducible complexities.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>When he established the force of the wind</br>
    and measured out the waters,</br>
when he made a decree for the rain</br>
    and a path for the thunderstorm,</br>
then he looked at wisdom and appraised it;</br>
    he confirmed it and tested it.</br>
And he said to the human race,</br>
    “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom,</br>
    and to shun evil is understanding.” - <b>Job 28:25-28</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>By wisdom the Lord laid the earth’s foundations,</br>
    by understanding he set the heavens in place;</br>
by his knowledge the watery depths were divided,</br>
    and the clouds let drop the dew. - <b>Proverbs 3:19-20</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wisdom</b> - God is the only source of true wisdom, and His instructions on how to get some wisdom for ourselves is simple: Fear the Lord your God.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, </br>
    and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. - <b>Proverbs 9:10</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>To fear the Lord is to hate evil;</br>
	I hate pride and arrogance,</br>
    evil behavior and perverse speech. - <b>Proverbs 9:10</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,</br>
    but fools despise wisdom and instruction. - <b>Proverbs 1:7</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for;</br>
	through the fear of the Lord evil is avoided. - <b>Proverbs 16:6</b></p>
				</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Wisdom is Older than Creation Itself</b> - Before the heavens and earth were made, God's wisdom was there. His wisdom therefore transcends all creation and is not dependent on creation.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>“The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works,</br>
    before his deeds of old;</br>
I was formed long ages ago,</br>
    at the very beginning, when the world came to be.</br>
When there were no watery depths, I was given birth,</br>
    when there were no springs overflowing with water;</br>
before the mountains were settled in place,</br>
    before the hills, I was given birth,</br>
before he made the world or its fields</br>
    or any of the dust of the earth.</br>
I was there when he set the heavens in place,</br>
    when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,</br>
when he established the clouds above</br>
    and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,</br>
when he gave the sea its boundary</br>
    so the waters would not overstep his command,</br>
and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.</br>
    Then I was constantly[c] at his side.</br>
I was filled with delight day after day,</br>
    rejoicing always in his presence,</br>
rejoicing in his whole world</br>
    and delighting in mankind. - <b>Proverbs 8:22-31</b></p>
			</pre>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Wisdom is a Constant Value</b> - Being foolish just makes life harder. In the same way that it is more difficult to find your way around in the dark, it is more difficult to live life without wisdom.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<pre>
				<p>I saw that wisdom is better than folly, </br>
    just as light is better than darkness. - <b>Ecclesiastes 2:13</b></p>
				</pre>
