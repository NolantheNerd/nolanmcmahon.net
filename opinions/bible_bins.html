		<h2>What's a Bible Bin?</h2>

		<p>God speaks to us through his holy, divinely inspired word: the Bible. It can be hard to keep track of all the stories, verses, and teachings that are relevant to all the various topics in the Word, hence this reference. A bin is a category which is supported by verses/stories from the Bible. This is an ever expanding list.</p>

		<h4>Awesomeness of God</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>God's Name</b> - The name of God is beyond our limited human understanding.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>He replied, "Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding." - <b>Judges 13:18</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Failure of Salvation by Works</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Human's Are Quick to Break God's Law</b> - God is in the middle of giving the Israelites massive victories over their enemies, and yet Achan still sins by stealing some of the items which were devoted to God.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions." - <b>Joshua 7:11</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Sin Prevents Us From Pleasing God</b> - Joshua makes the claim that the Israelites are not even capable of serving God. The works of the Israelites will not be sufficient.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Joshua said to the people, "You are not able to serve the Lord. He is a holy God; he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins. If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after he has been good to you." - <b>Joshua 24:19-20</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Faith</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Faith is a Path to Righteousness</b> - God spoke to Abram and promised him things that would not necessarily take place in his lifetime. Abram's belief in God and what God promised was credited to him as righteousness.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness. - <b>Genesis 15:6</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Faith in God is Reliable</b> - Ezra boasted about God's power to the king of Persia and as a result, was forced to depend on God for protection on his journey rather than the king's soldiers.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him." So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer. - <b>Ezra 8:22-23</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>God's Use of Lowly People</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>God Uses the Humble</b> - God chose Gideon to save Israel from the Midianites and become their judge, even though he described himself as the weakest family member from the weakest tribe in Manasseh.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"Pardon me, my lord," Gideon replied, "but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family." - <b>Judges 6:15</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God Uses Those That World Sees as Weak</b> - The Benjaminites were punished by the rest of Israel after their behaviour in Judges 19. Saul was a descendent of some the surviving Benjaminites, and as a consequence, would not have been the first choice by any human standard to be the first king of Israel. Yet God still decided to make him the first king.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Saul answered, "But am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?" - <b>1 Samuel 9:21</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God Can Elevate the Humble</b> - Saul started off believing that he was insignificant, even in his own eyes. But God made him the king over all of Israel.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Samuel said, "Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The Lord annointed you king over Israel." - <b>1 Samuel 15:17</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Greed</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Greed is Unquenchable</b> - From the worldly perspective, Haman had it all. He was second in command over a vast empire, he had a large family and lots of wealth, he had people bow down to him wherever he went. But all this was not enough. His greed destroyed him.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials. "And that's not all," Haman added. "I'm the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she had invited me along with the king tomorrow. But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king's gate." - <b>Esther 5:11-13</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>How God Works</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>God Does Not Change His Mind</b> - God can see the whole picture: past, present and future. Thus he does not ever need to change his mind.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind." - <b>1 Samuel 15:29</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God Makes Himself Known to Those Who Seek Him</b> - If you make a sincere effort to pursue God, He will reveal himself to you. But at the same time, if you reject Him, He will leave you to your sin.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge that God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the Lord searches every heart and understands every desire and every thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will reject you forever." - <b>1 Chronicles 28:9</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>You Can be a Part of God's Plan, But He Will Find a Way With or Without You</b> - Esther was terrified of going to the king to save the Jews from Haman, and for good reason. If the king did not "forgive" her for entering his presence without a summons, she would be killed. But it was God's plan for Esther to save the Jews, and that meant facing her fear and going to the king.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?" - <b>Esther 4:14</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Human Failings</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Sin is Innate in Human Beings</b> - The first man born on earth murdered the second man born on earth.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. - <b>Genesis 4:8</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Left to Ourselves, Humans Devolve into Pure Evil</b> - The entire population of the city of Sodom went to homosexually rape the angels that had come to the city.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom - both young and old - surrounded the house. They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them." - <b>Genesis 19:4-5</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Humans Are Profoundly Wicked</b> - Gibeah's men intended to maliciously abuse and exercise their power over the Levite traveler who was passing through their town by raping him. They would not accept his concubine and a virgin as a substitute, but raped them continuously throughout the night until she died.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>While they were enjoying themselves, some of the men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, "Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him."<br><br>
					The owner of the house went outside and said to them, "No my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this outrageous thing. Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But as for this man, don't do such an outrageous thing."</br></br>
					But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. - <b>Judges 19:22-25</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Even Under Perfect Conditions, Humans Are Still Profoundly Evil</b> - David had it all, he was king over all Israel, the Lord had given him rest on all sides from his enemies, and he had the blessing of God's covenant on him. And yet, even with all that going right for him, he still commited what humans consider to be the worst possible sin: he murdered Uriah the Hittite because he was lustful for Bathsheba.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man! This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: 'I annointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. I gave your master's house to you, and your master's wives into your arms. I gave you all Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more. Why did you despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.'" - <b>2 Samuel 12:7-10</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Pride</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Stay Humble, For God Rules Over You</b> - Despite being second only to Pharaoh, Joseph didn't let his pride go to his head. He had the opportunity to enslave his brothers and punish them for what they did to him, but he rhetorically responds: "Am I in the place of God?".</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>But Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God?" - <b>Genesis 50:19</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Prophesy of Christ</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Jacob's Prediction</b> - In Jacob's blessing of Judah, he mentions that "the scepter will not depart from Judah ... until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his."</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet,</br>until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his. - <b>Genesis 49:18</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>God's Promise to David</b> - God made a promise to David that his offspring would establish a kingdom that would last forever.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"'He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever.'" - <b>2 Samuel 7:13,16</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Questions for a Theologian</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>What was David's Sin?</b> - David enrolls the fighting men in Israel after God prompts him to. But as a consequence, God sends a disease on the land that kills seventy thousand Israelites. In verse 10, David is "conscience-stricken". What was his sin?</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the Lord, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, Lord, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing." - <b>2 Samuel 24:10</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Revenge</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Vengence is God's, Not Ours</b> - David would not kill Saul, even when the circumstances he found himself in gave him the perfect opportunity to do so. David was content with God's promise that he would be king. He felt no need to rush the process by taking action himself.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"As surely as the Lord lives," he said, "the Lord himself will strike him, or his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish. But the Lord forbid that I should lay a hand on the Lord's annointed." - <b>1 Samuel 26:10-11</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Satan</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>What the Devil is Like</b> - Here the devil is described as being more crafty that any of the other animals that God made.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?" - <b>Genesis 3:1</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Evil Spirits Exist and Can Torment People</b> - Saul had disobeyed God, so in the place of the Spirit of the Lord, God sent an evil spirit to torment him.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Now the Spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him. - <b>1 Samuel 16:14</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Satan Schemes Against Man</b> - Don't be deceived. The devil does exist and does make an effort to disrupt the work of God on earth by deceiving human beings.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied. "Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face." - <b>Job 1:9-11</b></p>
				<p>"Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life. But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face." - <b>Job 2:4-5</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Satan Never Admits Defeat</b> - Satan incited God to strike Job by taking away all of his belongings. Satan claimed that Job would curse God, but Job did not. Instead of admitting that he was wrong, he simply moved the goalposts by claiming instead that Job would curse God if God took away Job's physical health.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Then the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason." - <b>Job 2:3</b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<li><b>Satan's Routine</b> - Satan roams around the earth, looking to stir up trouble. Don't think that he's far off, or not paying attention.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The Lord said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"<br></br>
					Satan answered the Lord, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it." - <b>Job 1:7</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Suffering</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>God Can Use Your Suffering for Good</b> - Joseph went through alot of suffering in his life. But he was convinced that his suffering had a purpose: to save many lives.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. - <b>Genesis 45:5</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>Symbols</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Don't Confuse Religious Symbolism for a Relationship with God</b> - The Israelites confused a genuine relationship with God through faith, sacrifice, and obedience with the symbol that the ark of the covenant. As a consequence, the ark was lost to the Philistines and many Israelites were slain.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the Lord bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the Lord's covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies." - <b>1 Samuel 4:3</b></p>
			</blockquote>
		</ul>

		<h4>The Law</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Obedience is Better than Sacrifice</b> - In Saul's arrogance, he did not obey what God told him to do when he attacked the Amalekites. Instead of killing all of the livestock, he took them back to sacrifice to the Lord. Samuel told Saul that obedience is better than sacrifice to God.</li>
			<blockquote>
				<p>But Samuel replied:</br></br>
					"Does the Lord delight in burnt offering and sacrifices as much as in obeying the Lord? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams." - <b>1 Samuel 15:22</b></p>
			</blockquote>
