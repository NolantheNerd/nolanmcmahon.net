		<h2>News Flash!</h2>

		<p>Extra! Extra! Read all about it! News should be ignored!</p>

		<p>As human beings, our curiosity drives us to want to know about what is going on around us. For most people, this means hooking themselves into their favourite news outlet. After all, the news shares with us what is going on in our neighbourhoods, cities, regions, countries, and around the world. But regardless of whether you prefer your news served to you on the carcass of a dead tree or etched into your retinas by your screen of choice, the news is toxic to you mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and financially.</p>

		<h3>Breaking (down the) News</h3>

		<p>Despite the clever guise that the news is here to inform you, it is not. Most news outlets are privately held institutions. They have an obligation to their shareholders to turn a profit. While presenting the news is partially correlated with turning a profit for a news company, its not their north star. In order to maximize their profitability, they need to encourage you to sign up, and give them your personal information, and keep you engrossed on their site as long as possible so that they can unsurreptitiously stuff you as full of ads as they possibly can.</p>

		<p>Like almost every other company competing in the digital sphere, news companies capture your attention by toying with your psychology. They twist articles to evoke fear and anger. They never close a big, breaking story. Even one which could be comfortably summarized in a handful of sentences is drawn out through the chronicling of many near identical witnesses testimonies, the exhortations of pompous "experts", and the regurgitation of the public's reaction through the recitation of trending tweets and opinion pieces. This turns a story into an epic - which may be justifiable on rare occasion. In this way you are compelled to stay tuned indefinitely to hear some miniscule piece of information that has not already been spat out.</p>

		<p>Unbiased news is also incredibly hard to come by. Some institutions claim to strive for this highest of Cronkitic standards, but ask the man on the street, and he'll tell you that CNN and MSNBC are liberal outlets, Fox News is a conservative outlet, and Buzzfeed is not a news outlet at all. In this way, most news outlets have siloed audiences, those that subscribe to the bias presented by their organization of choice. Furthermore, much of the discussion within these ideological ecosystems are focused on insulting those on the other side than actually clarifying the details of the days current events.</p>

		<p>Stories also tend to have a negative focus. If your only source of information about humanity was the news, you'd be forced to conclude that nothing good has ever happened, and that quality of life has monotonically decreased forever, leaving everyone nostalgic for their own perceived utopian childhood years when, ironically, they were the least aware of current events. Granted, the blame for the negativity of current events does not lay squarely at the feet of the news presenters. Bad news tends to happen all at once (a shooting, a natural disaster, etc) while good news usually unfolds gradually (lifting millions out of poverty, reducing homelessness, etc). That being said, whenever they are given the opportunity, news anchors lean towards instilling fear and anger with the stories that they present in order to keep you engaged just long enough to plaster one more ad on the back of your retina.</p>

		<p>For these reasons: I do not watch the news on TV, I do not read the newspaper, I do not listen to the news on the radio, and I do not read news or news adjacent websites. In fact, with regards to news websites, I go one step further. I block them entirely. If I haphazardly click on a link to an New York Times article, my browser will refuse to load the page. I hear many common concerns from people when I tell them that I do not pay any attention to the news.</p>

		<h3>Addressing the Critics</h3>

		<ol>

			<li>What if something really important happens? Don't you want to know about it?</li>
			
			<p>Do you remember what was breaking news a month ago? (At the time of writing, it was probably some COVID-19 related news) You might be able to recall one, maybe two headlines. Do you remember the details of the articles? If you are like most people, you probably can't. If the news was so incredibly important, don't you think that you'd remember the details longer than a few days to a week? My philosophy is that if a news item is still relevant a month after its initial publication, it <em>might be</em> important.</p>

			<p>Now for the greatest part of my news-ignoring system: unless you live under a rock (in which case the news has no impact on your life anyway) people around you are talking about it. What a great conversation starter that is! "Hey, did you hear the news last night?" "No! What happened?" "Really?! I can't believe you hadn't heard! Well..." This makes other people like a filter for your news intake. You only get the most important news, and you get the condensed few sentences that you theoretically wanted from the news outlets at the beginning. Trust me, nothing important will pass you by. If push comes to shove, the government will plaster pamphlets on every door, wall, and lamppost to get your attention (like with COVID-19 safety guidelines). You can't escape knowing about the most important news if you try!</p>

			<li>But don't you want to be informed about the world around you?</li>

			<p>Absolutely! But what makes you think that the news is actually informing you about what is going on around you. My time is much better spent reading something out of a textbook, or in a software manual than from the news!</p>

			<li>The news channel is a great source of background noise. Isn't it nice to just have it running in the background while you work? You don't have to pay attention to it.</li>

			<p>I disagree with the entire premise. There is no need to fill each and every waking instant with noise. Peace and quiet is a wonderful thing to be savoured, not squandered. When I do want to work to some background noise, music is always a far better option.</p>

		</ol>

		<h3>The Most Important Reasons for Boycotting the News</h3>

		<p>When it comes down to it, there are even more important reasons: some personal, some financial, and some biblical for ignoring the news.</p>

		<ul>

			<li><h4>The News Uses Fear to Hold Your Attention</h4>Jesus is quite clear about fear and worry. In the Sermon on the Mount, He says: "Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?" (Matthew 7:27) "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own." (Matthew 7:34)</li>

			<li><h4>The News Profits by Selling Your Attention to Advertisers</h4>Being someone who works directly in advertising technology, I can speak directly to this one. Since day one, it has always amazed me how much money advertising brings in for those who do it. You may think that it doesn't work on you, but that's what everyone thinks and most people are wrong.</li>

			<li><h4>The News Has No Respect for Your Time</h4>The longer a news network can get you to stay on their site, the more money they make. This has an unbelievable opportunity cost for you as a news consumer. The 24-hour news cycle will never willingly let you pursue your hobbies and interests. The best way to break free is immediately and cold turkey.</li>

			<li><h4>The News is Not Relevant</h4>Simply put, if something is <em>really</em> important, other people will make sure that you know about it.</li>

			<li><h4>The News Has No Substance</h4>If you are truly curious about what is happening in the world, the news is perhaps the worst way to learn about it. Unbiased informative content is not what they are motivated to deliver.</li>

			<li><h4>The News Has No Direct Connection to Your Life</h4>The news discusses large, vague stories that are disconnected from your daily reality. As such, they have no impact on how you live your life. (If something impactful does come up, people will make sure you know about it even if you don't follow the news.) If you really want to know what's going on in a realm that's relevant to you, go talk to the people you care about: your family, friends and co-workers.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>Those are my reasons for ignoring the news. You can do it too! I live a much happier and more joyful life as a consequence. You'll be just fine, I promise. Want some help? Try installing my news site block list. In fact, while you're at it, why not block social media, porn, and ads too?</p>
