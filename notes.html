	<h2>Studying God's Creation</h2>
	<p>In spite of my formal education in physics, I sincerely believe that God created the universe. As such, studying how the universe works is a way in which I can peer into the creative mind of God. Doing so is a form of worship. Afterall:</p>
	<pre>The heavens declare the glory of God;
	the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
Day after day they pour forth speech;
	night after night they reveal knowledge.
They have no speech, they use no words;
	no sound is heard from them.
Yet their voice goes out into all the earth,
	their words to the ends of the world. ...
						<i>Psalm 19:1-4</i> (NIV)</pre>
