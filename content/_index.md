## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Nolan! 

![A Picture of Me](/me.jpg)

I am a:

* Devout Protestant Christian
* Scientist, holding an honours BSc in Physics from the University of Calgary
* Machine Learning Specialist at a marketing-tech company
* Life-Long Self Directed Learner
* Self-Described Cyclist

I talk about these aspects of myself (and more) at length in this capsule. If you'd like a more detailed description of me, check out my about page. Or, if a resume is more your speed, you can see that here as well.
