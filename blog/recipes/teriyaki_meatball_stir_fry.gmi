### Stir-fry

* 1 1/2 Cups Basmati Rice

* Preheat Oven to 375Â°F

## Directions:

* In a large bowl, add all meatball ingredients. Mix with your hands, squeezing the meat between your fingers.
* Between your palms, roll meatballs. They should be between loonie and golf ball sized. Place each meatball onto the baking tray.
* Bake meatballs for 20 minutes.
* Remove meatballs from the oven and individually spoon them onto the paper towel lined plate. Dab the meatballs with another paper towel to remove as much grease as possible.
* Meanwhile, in a large pot, add corn starch and room temperature water. Whisk carefully until homogeneous. Then add remaining teriyaki sauce ingredients.
* Heat sauce on medium heat until it boils, stirring frequently to prevent the sauce from burning.
* Once it boils, whisk intensely for 15 seconds.
* Turn down heat to low. Add vegetables, pineapple, and baked meatballs. Let simmer for 75 minutes, stirring regularly.
* Meanwhile, make rice. Without a rice cooker: add rice and water to a pot and heat on high. Let boil for 15 minutes or until all water has evaporated/absorbed.
* Top bed of rice with meatball/vegetable/sauce mixture and enjoy!
