## Directions:

* Cut each chicken breast in half depth-wise creating two thinner chicken breast shaped pieces.
* Prepare an assembly line-like structure with the melted butter, breadcrumb mixture, chicken on a cutting board, and a glass baking dish.

* Bake for 5 more minutes or until cheese is melted.
* Enjoy!
